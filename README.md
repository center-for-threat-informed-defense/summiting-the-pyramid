## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help advance
threat-informed defense:

- **Review the project model and methodology and tell us what you think.** We welcome
  your feedback on any aspect of the project: from high-level concepts to low-level
  technical details.
- **Request analytics and observables.** Send your [analytic
  requests]([/stix/attack-flow-schema-2.0.0.json](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/summiting-the-pyramid/issues/new/choose))
  to our team. As we have time, we will work them through the process and publish scores
  and analysis.
- **Submit your own analytics and observables.** We encourage you to use the methodology
  to work through analytics or observables and send your results in a pull request so
  that we can make them available to the entire community.
