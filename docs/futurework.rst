The Summiting the Pyramid project is planning to look at other areas of research:

* Characterizing suitability of ATT&CK techniques to various levels of robustness
* Performing lexical analysis and automated scoring of selected analytic query languages
* Generalizing the scoring methodology to additional operating systems and platforms
* Analyzing multi-analytic robustness scoring, where one or more analytics depend on or
  relate to each other, chains of techniques, and so on

If you have any thoughts to future areas of research, please submit a `GitHub issue
