Telemetry Strategy & Readiness
================================

.. epigraph::

  Detection strength begins with the right telemetry. We prioritize high-value data collection, assess telemetry effectiveness, and ensure logging is configured to support robust behavioral inference — not just atomic matching.

* Telemetry Effectiveness Assessment

  *Evaluating how well a telemetry source supports robust detection*

  * :ref:`Creating Detection Decomposition Diagrams<d3>` to evaluate overlapping analytic observables and assess gaps and redundancies

* Logging Standards & Instrumentation

  *Defining how telemetry must be configured to support analytics*

* Data Quality & Scheme Engineering

  *Ensuring data fields are reliable enough to build logic on*

* Entity & Context Modeling

  *Creating consistent identity, host, and lineage models so analytics can infer intent*
