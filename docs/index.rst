Summiting the Pyramid is a research project focused on engineering cyber analytics to
make adversary evasion more difficult. This project is created and maintained by the
`MITRE Center for Threat-Informed Defense <https://ctid.mitre.org/>`__ in futherance of
our mission to advance the state of the art and the state of the practice in
threat-informed defense globally.

    **What's New In V3:**

    In version 3.0, we updated and improved the project in the following ways!

    * Defined a framework for deriving :ref:`malicious intent <Intent
      Definition>` for :ref:`ambiguous techniques<AT Definition>`.
    * Identified a method to employ co-occuring techniques to support
      :ref:`chained analytic development<Chaining Analytics>`.
    * Developed a :ref:`context-based methodology<Context>` for deriving
      malicious intent when engineering robust analytics with lower false
      positive rates.
