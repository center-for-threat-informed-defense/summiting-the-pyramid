Summiting the Pyramid is a research project focused on engineering cyber analytics to
make adversary evasion more difficult. This project is created and maintained by the
`MITRE Center for Threat-Informed Defense <https://ctid.mitre.org/>`__ in futherance of
our mission to advance the state of the art and the state of the practice in
threat-informed defense globally.

    **What's New In V4:**

    In version 4.0, we updated and improved the project in the following ways!

    * Defined a methodology for identifying the :ref:`minimum telemetry requirements<mintelreq>` for ambiguous techniques.
    * Developed a process for calculating :ref:`Telemetry Quality<Telemetry Quality>' scores that provide relative detection effectiveness potentials. We also extended this work to look at groupings of techniques with similiar objectives called :ref:`use cases<Use Cases>` and leveraged :ref:`automation via AI/LLM<automation>` to assist with the analysis.
    * Re-factored the Summiting website to better align to CTID's portfolio of :ref:`Detection Engineering<Detection Engineering>` work.
