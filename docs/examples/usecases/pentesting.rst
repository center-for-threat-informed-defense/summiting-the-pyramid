Penetration Testing Tools
==========================

Description of Use Case
------------------------
The scoring for this use case was a clear victory for telemetry sources that provide deep, behavioral insight into process execution and memory. The highest-scoring logs were not generic event logs, but highly specific ones designed to catch the behaviors of adversary tools—such as credential dumping, process injection, and fileless execution—rather than just the tools themselves.

Key Trends & Generalizations
------------------------------
* **Detect the Behavior, Not the Tool**: The highest-scoring logs don't look for mimikatz.exe. They look for the behavior of a process accessing LSASS memory. This behavioral approach is far more robust and resilient to attackers renaming or obfuscating their tools.

* **Fileless Attacks are the Norm**: The high ranking of PowerShell Script Block Logging and process injection detectors (Sysmon EID 8) confirms that modern adversary tradecraft is heavily reliant on in-memory and script-ba
