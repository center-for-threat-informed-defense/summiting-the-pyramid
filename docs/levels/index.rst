When developing the Summiting the Pyramid Project, we needed to determine how to group different observables and data sources, or parts of an analytic, and how to 
rank them. Currently, we have described these levels as the **Difficulty of Bypassing Analytic Observables**.  The following pages document the levels we have with observables.

**Levels: Analytic Observables**
There are five levels which are grouped based on how difficult it is for an adversary to evade the analytic observable.

    implementations
    preexisting_tool
    adversary_tool
    ephemeral

**Columns: Data Sources**
There are also three columns which describe the different data sources based on their visibility into the OS.
