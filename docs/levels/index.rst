When developing the Summiting the Pyramid Project, we needed to determine how to group different observables and sensor data, or parts of an analytic, and how to 
rank them. Currently, we have described these levels as the **Difficulty of Bypassing Analytic Observables**.  The following pages document the levels we have with observables.

**Levels: Analytic Robustness Categories**
There are five levels which are grouped based on how difficult it is for an adversary to evade the analytic observable.

    ephemeral

**Columns: Sensor Robustness Categories**
There are currently three columns which describe sensor data based on their visibility into the OS.
