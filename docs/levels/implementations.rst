Level 4: Core to Some Implementations of (Sub-)Technique
--------------------------------------------------------

**Description**: Observables associated with low-variance behaviors of the (sub-)technique, unavoidable without a substantially different implementation.

Analytics that are core to some implementations of a technique or sub-technique look at the behaviors an adversary will demonstrate during an attack. These behaviors are defined as low variance behaviorsâ€”those which cannot be avoided by the implementation. Multiple implementations may point to the same low variance behavior, allowing a defender to create a robust analytic.

.. note::

    These observables may change if the definition of the technique is modified in a
    new version of ATT&CK.
