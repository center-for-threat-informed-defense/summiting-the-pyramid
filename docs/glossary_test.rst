=============
This page will be updated with terms key to the development of the Summiting the Pyramid's research and methodology development.

.. glossary:: 
    Precision
        The ratio of true positives to total positive results given by an analytic

    Recall
        Recall is the ratio of true positives to total relevant malicious events
    
    Observable
        An observable is an event, either benign or malicious, that is generated on a network or system and is visible to a defender.

    Analytic
        An analytic is query logic used for detecting activity within different technology mediums using Boolean combinations of, or statistical analysis, of observables
    
    Detection
        Detections are the result of an analytic

    Level
        A level is the grouping of observables and analytics based on difficulty and cost for an adversary to avoid triggering or being detected by them

    Robustness
        Robustness measures the effort needed by an adversary to evade an analytic

    Capability Abstraction
        Capability abstraction attempts to find common touch points between tools, making capabilities less hidden from defenders
