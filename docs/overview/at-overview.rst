Ambiguous Techniques Overview
==============================

Determining Malicious Intent for Ambiguous Techniques
-------------------------------------------------------

For :ref:`ambiguous techniques<AT Definition>`, invariant behaviors overlap
significantly between malicious and benign implementations, and so more
:ref:`context<Context Definition>` is needed to differentiate malicious
:ref:`intent<Intent Definition>` and behavior, otherwise detection analytics
risk drowning in false positives.  There is also a need when trying to identify
differentiators to maintain as high a level of robustness as possible, so that
you don't render the analytic ineffective in trying to gain a higher level of
precision.
