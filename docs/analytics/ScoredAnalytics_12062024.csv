Diagnostic Library Sdiageng.DLL Loaded By Msdt.EXE,1,,,,An adversary could evade this analytic by renaming both observables used.,https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/image_load/image_load_dll_sdiageng_load_by_msdt.yml
Windows Defender Threat Detected,4,,,,These eventIDs will require further research to score,https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/30bee7204cc1b98a47635ed8e52f44fdf776c602/rules/windows/other/win_defender_threat.yml 
WMI Persistence,4,,,,Changes to WMI subscriptions are well covered by a number of EventIDs and this takes advantage of that leading to a very difficult to eveade detection.,https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/wmi/win_wmi_persistence.yml
Windows Defender Malware Detection History Deletion,4,,,,"Because there is an event ID specificly for the behavior, this is considered a very robust technique.",https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/windefend/win_defender_history_delete.yml
Eventlog Cleared,4,,,,The eventID 104 is for 'The %3 log file was cleared' And when the provider name is that of the event log it would have been cleared. This looks to be dependent on the OS file locations. ,https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/system/win_system_eventlog_cleared.yml
Suspicious Encoded Scripts in a WMI Consumer,2,,,,This is looking for artifacts in a script within the adversary's control.,https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/wmi_event/sysmon_wmi_susp_encoded_scripts.yml

Flash Player Update from Suspicious Location,1H or 2H?,,,,"Detects for fake flashplayer updates, so detects for URI's that mimic Adobe's normal '/flash_install.php' or '/install_flash_player.exe'. Though these URI's are ephemeral, changing them would counteract the whole point of masquerading as valid updates.",https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/6fd57da13139643c6fe3e4a23276ca6ae9a6eec7/rules/web/proxy_generic/proxy_susp_flash_download_loc.yml

HTTP Request With Empty User Agent,?H,,,,"Detects a empty user agent string in the proxy log. This is in the Header, but I am unsure what to score it. I don't feel like an empty string should be considered ephemeral, as changing it would negate its purpose.",https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/6fd57da13139643c6fe3e4a23276ca6ae9a6eec7/rules/web/proxy_generic/proxy_ua_empty.yml
