Research Notes and Caveats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This activity has many IOCs that individually donâ€™t have much context but when put together leverage Native 
Windows tools behavior to detect the DLLHost activity. This also makes use of a keyword search that is very 
challenging to score as it can be found in any field and still detect the activity. The way I scored this 
was with the expected fields it would be found in. Also with the OR logic I was able to link together lower 
level detection with lower level detection and together they still provide more robust detection capabilities.
