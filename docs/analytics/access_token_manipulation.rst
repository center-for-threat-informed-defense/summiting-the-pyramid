This analytic's robustness score is **1U** because it relies on commands being run from ``cmd.exe``. While some observables of the analytic score at level 2, they are ORed with level 1 
making the overall analytic score at 1U. This analytic also relies on an adversary accidentally entering these commands on the victim machine since the specified 
arguments are typically executed on a beacon within CobaltStrike. 

We can generate an analytic that scores scores higher according to the Summiting methodoogy by researching what happens on a system when a token is impersonated.
The original analytic spans several different behaviors, tactics, and techniques including process injection, privilege escalation, 
lateral movement, access token manipulation, and credential access, so we also need to re-scope our analytic and focus on a single ATT&CK technique. Weâ€™ll continue 
with **T1134.001 Access Token Manipulation: Token Impersonation/Theft**. We will further scope down our research, focusing on access token theft implementations that 
leverage Windows API calls versus command line implementations like the ``runas`` command.

Test scripts were executed to call Windows APIs commonly used by adversaries and/or tools when performing access token manipulation, as seen on the ATT&CK page [#f1]_:

  - LogonUser
  - DuplicateTokenEx
  - ImpersonateLogonUser

Testing confirmed that calling these APIs generated Event ID 4624 (An account has been logged on).

.. note::
  ``Audit Logon`` events must be configured in Local System or Group Policy to capture Event ID 4624

With knowledge that event ID 4624 [#f2]_ is fired anytime an adversary performs access token manipulation, we can now begin to develop a new analytic. Simply searching for 
Event ID 4624 would be incredibly noisy on a production environment, therefore defenders must leverage other fields in the event to filter out false positives. 
Fortunately, the Summiting team has gone through this process already, submitted the improved analytic to Sigma through previous research [#f3]_, and started developing a capability abstraction map. The team is continuing the research to find better event IDs or other observables which can be correlated to access tokens specifically.
